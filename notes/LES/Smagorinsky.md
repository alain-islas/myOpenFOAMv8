# Smagorinsky

The Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SGS) model was developed by J. Smagorinsky in the
metereological community in 1963. It is based on the eddy viscosity assumption,
which postulates a linear relationship between the SGS shear stress and the resolved
rate of strain tensor. This model serves as a base for other SGS models.


The subgrid scale stress tensor $\tau_{ij}$ is
$$\tau_{ij}=\overline{u_{i}u_{j}}-\overline{u_{i}}\overline{u_{j}}$$
