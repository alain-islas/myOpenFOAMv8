# Smagorinsky

The Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SGS) model was developed by J. Smagorinsky in the
metereological community in 1963. It is based on the eddy viscosity assumption,
which postulates a linear relationship between the SGS shear stress and the re-
solved rate of strain tensor. This model serves as a base for other SGS models.


The subgrid scale stress tensor $\tau_{ij}$ is

\begin{equation}
    \tau_{ij}=\overbar{u_{i}u_{j}} - \bar{u_{i}}\bar{u_{j}}
\end{equation}
